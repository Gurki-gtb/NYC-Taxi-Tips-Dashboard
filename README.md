# NYC-Taxi-Tips-Dashboard

## 📊 Overview 
This interactive dashboard explores tipping behavior in New York City using publicly avaliable data, which I personally pulled from Google's big Query. It revolves around how tip percentages changed based on fare amounts, passenger count, drop off zone, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools Used 
- Google Looker Studio
- Google Sheets (data source)
- Public NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission dataset

## ‼️ Dashboard Features 
- Bar Chart of average tip percentage by zone
- Controls to filter the data based on: Pickup Date, Pickup Zone, Dropoff Zone, Tip Amount, Passenger Count
- A scatter plot showing the relationship between the fare amount and tip amount
- Table containing a ton of information about taxi trips made, along with the tips
